# Description
- An experiment has taken place which measures the reaction speeds of students. Each student is aged from 12 to 16, and belongs to a school house (Saturn or Mars). A program is required to store the age, school house and reaction time of each student in the school. There are 650 students in the school. 

- The program should be able to output the reaction times of different student groups.
- Write and test a program for the school. 
    - Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. 
    - Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly. 
    - All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names. 
- You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.
  
## TASK 1 – Set up arrays and store records 
- Set up one-dimensional arrays for the whole school to store the following data:
  - The age of each student in whole years
  - The school house of each student
  - The reaction time of each student
- Input and store the records for an appropriate sample of students. Inputs must be validated on entry and any invalid inputs rejected.

## TASK 2 – Output school house based statistics
- Using your sample, calculate and output the average reaction times for students in Saturn and students in Mars. 

## TASK 3 – Output statistics based on user input
- Extend your program to prompt users to input a specific age and school house. Using only records that match the criteria input, the program should identify, calculate and output:
  - The average reaction time
  - The slowest reaction time
- The output should include a suitable message for each of the reaction times identified.
